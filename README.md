Another challenge completed! This one was to practice using HTTP clients consuming the Github API to create a personal blog. In this challenge, I developed an application that uses the GitHub API to fetch issues from a repository, data from your profile, and displays this information as a blog.

Listing your profile with image, number of followers, name, and other information available through the GitHub API.
Listing and filtering all the issues from the repository with a brief summary of their content.
Creating a page to display a complete post (issue).
In this project, I used: Fetch / Axios, Routing and React Router DOM, Forms. The GitHub APIs used: GitHub Users API, GitHub Search API, and GitHub Issues API.
